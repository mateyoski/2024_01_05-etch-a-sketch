This is my approach to The Odin Project's 'Etch-a-Sketch' exercise.
Users can draw on a canvas using square elements. There is a slider which changes the size of the grid in a range starting at 8x8 to 64x64.

## Features

```

- **Size Selection:** Users can set the size of the canvas in the range of 8x8 to 64*x64 by using a slider above the canvas. The slider displays the current size above it.
- **Resetting the canvas:** Users can clear the canvas by clicking on the button above the slider

```
